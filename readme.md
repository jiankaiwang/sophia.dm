# Data Mining in Sophia Project

Data mining refers to extracting or mining information (or say knowledge) from huge amounts of data. Someone might regard data mining as "Knowledge mining" or treat it as a synonym for a popular term, KDD (Knowledge Discovery from Data). But these fields are essentially different from data mining, for example, ignoring the large amounts of data. Data mining is also regarded as a misnomer because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from huge amounts of data, not the mining of data itself.

In the [sophia.dm](https://github.com/jiankaiwang/sophia.dm) project, we try and provide you the foundation of each fields related to the data mining. Most of fields in the project are built on R, Shiny and Plotly. Please enjoy it and explore the world of data mining.
